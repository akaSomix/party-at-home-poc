# Party At Home POC

## ✨ The Purpose 
This Demo App purpose is to expose a API written in Typescript, designed to access a Serverless Database (Cockroach DB), while using Prisma as ORM.
The final goal is to enstablish a working standard for my JS/TS API that is simple, adaptable, extendable... but mostly that WORKS 😝.

## 🥳 The App Context
We are trying to design a simple CRUD Application that manages Parties at Home. Every user will be able to create and manage parties at their house, while being able to subscribe to other's parties. 

## 🏗️ The Tech Stack
- **Language:** Typescript
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Database**: CockroachDB (Serverless PostgreSQL Like)

## 🛣️ The Roadmap

- [x] Write this Readme
- [x] Application Initial Setup
- [x] API definition and mock ups
- [ ] Prisma Data layer definition and DB Connection
- [ ] Replace mockups with working business logic
- [ ] Add Vagrant for local setup
